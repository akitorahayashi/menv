# Generate Prompts

## Role

Prompt Engineer

## Context

- `.tmp/requirements.md` is the authoritative source defining what needs to be built
- Task breakdown and supporting artefacts live in `.tmp/`

## Your task

### 1. Gather the plan inputs

- Open `.tmp/tasks.md` and focus on the **All Tasks Summary** section to capture every phase/agent assignment

### 2. Draft activation messaging

- Turn each checkbox entry into a direct instruction that references `.tmp/tasks.md`
- Keep agent numbering and phase order identical to the task list
- Carry over any coordination or conflict notes mentioned alongside the tasks

### 3. Record the prompts

- Write `.tmp/prompts.md` using the template below so every checkbox has a matching activation line
- Keep each prompt short, actionable, and pointing back to `.tmp/tasks.md`

## Notes

- Do not edit `.tmp/tasks.md` or any other artefactâ€”your sole deliverable is `.tmp/prompts.md`.
- When a phase assigns multiple checklist items to the same agent (e.g., multiple `Task n summary` entries in `sdd-4-tk.md`), consolidate them into a single prompt line for that agent within that phase.

# Activation Prompts - [Task Name]

## Guidance
- Prompts must stay in sync with `.tmp/tasks.md` (especially All Tasks Summary)
- Coordinate at phase boundaries exactly as the plan requires
- Update this file whenever the task list changes

## Prompts by Phase

### Phase 1
- **Agent 1**: "You are agent1. Read `.tmp/requirements.md`, `.tmp/design.md`, and `.tmp/tasks.md`. Execute Phase 1 tasks assigned to Agent 1."
- **Agent 2**: "You are agent2. Read `.tmp/requirements.md`, `.tmp/design.md`, and `.tmp/tasks.md`. Execute Phase 1 tasks assigned to Agent 2."
- **Agent 3**: "You are agent3. Read `.tmp/requirements.md`, `.tmp/design.md`, and `.tmp/tasks.md`. Execute Phase 1 tasks assigned to Agent 3."
- **Agent 4**: "You are agent4. Read `.tmp/requirements.md`, `.tmp/design.md`, and `.tmp/tasks.md`. Execute Phase 1 tasks assigned to Agent 4."
- **Reviewer**: "Phase 1 agent work complete. Review merged changes, resolve conflicts, verify build and tests pass."

### Phase 2
- **Agent 1**: "Phase 1 integration is complete. Read `.tmp/tasks.md` and execute your Phase 2 tasks for Agent 1."
- **Agent 2**: "Phase 1 integration is complete. Read `.tmp/tasks.md` and execute your Phase 2 tasks for Agent 2."
- **Reviewer**: "Phase 2 agent work complete. Review merged changes, resolve conflicts, verify build and tests pass."

### Phase 3
- **Agent 1**: "Phase 2 integration is complete. Read `.tmp/tasks.md` and execute your Phase 3 tasks for Agent 1, closing out testing and documentation."
- **Agent 2**: "Phase 2 integration is complete. Read `.tmp/tasks.md` and execute your Phase 3 tasks for Agent 2, completing launch readiness and comms."
- **Agent 3**: "Phase 2 integration is complete. Read `.tmp/tasks.md` and execute your Phase 3 tasks for Agent 3."
- **Reviewer**: "Phase 3 agent work complete. Review merged changes, resolve conflicts, verify build and tests pass."

Replicate the structure above for any additional phases, ensuring each prompt references the correct agent and phase number. Add a Reviewer prompt after each phase for human orchestration.
