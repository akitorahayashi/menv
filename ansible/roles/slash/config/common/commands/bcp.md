1. Run `git diff` to review the changes you are about to commit.
2. Pick a branch name that matches the work (e.g. `feat/add-user-auth`).
3. Create and switch with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
4. Stage and commit all changes with `git add . && git commit -m "<message>"`.
5. Push with `git push -u origin <branch-name>`.
