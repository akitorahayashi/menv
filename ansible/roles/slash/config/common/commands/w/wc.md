# /wc - Work on tasks critically

Perform critical planning to create a robust execution strategy, and then immediately execute that strategy.

This command is for complex tasks where the path forward is not immediately clear and requires strategic thought before action.

**Important:** Ensure the entire workflow completes fully without premature termination. Do not stop mid-phase; complete all steps in each phase before proceeding.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Critical Planning

1.  **Analyze Goal:** Study the user's request and any existing plan in `.tmp/tasks.md`.
2.  **Critically Review Scope:** Critically review the scope of edits needed, considering what might be missing in the plan, and ensure sufficient editing is contemplated for the goal.
4.  **Create Revised Plan:** Create `.tmp/revised_tasks.md` to make it more robust.

### Phase 2: Execution

4.  **Implement:** Execute the newly defined plan from `.tmp/revised_tasks.md`. Complete the entire implementation without interruption before moving to verification.
5.  **Verify:** Run tests and validations to confirm the implementation is successful.
