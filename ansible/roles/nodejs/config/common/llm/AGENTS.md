# Rules

- All development-related documentation must be written in English.
- Keep documentation for LLM (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) concise for token efficiency. Focus on essential information only.
- `docs/` files are reference onlyâ€”do not update unless explicitly requested by user or slash commands.
