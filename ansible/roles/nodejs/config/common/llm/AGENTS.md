# Rules

- All development-related documentation must be written in English.
- Keep documentation for LLM (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) concise for token efficiency. Focus on essential information only.
- Never define class or file names with ambiguous responsibilities, such as base, utils, or helpers.
