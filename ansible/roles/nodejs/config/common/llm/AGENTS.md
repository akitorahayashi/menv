# Rules

- All development-related documentation must be written in English.
- When adding new features or refactoring, removal of old modules and deprecated features is mandatory. Identify and eliminate all sources of technical debt, bugs, and complexity left behind.
- Never define class or file names with ambiguous responsibilities, such as base, utils, or helpers.
- Keep documentation for LLM (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) concise for token efficiency. Focus on essential information only.
- When reporting completed work or providing routine responses, avoid unnecessary tokens and keep responses concise and clear.
