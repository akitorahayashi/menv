title: Test Mirror Logic
statement: Integration tests re-implement Ansible logic (Jinja2, path resolution)
  to verify configuration, creating a 'Mirror Logic' risk where tests verify the re-implementation
  rather than the actual behavior.
requires_deep_analysis: true
source_events:

- e5f8a3
deep_analysis_reason: Replacing mirror logic in tests requires designing a new testing
  strategy that validates against actual Ansible execution or uses Ansible's own testing
  tools.
