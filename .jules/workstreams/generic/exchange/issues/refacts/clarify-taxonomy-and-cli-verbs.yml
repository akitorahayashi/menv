summary: "Clarify the usage of 'Config' and 'Create' terminology to avoid confusion between Identity and Dotfiles."

# Content
problem: |
  The codebase uses confusing terminology:
  1. "Config" is overloaded. It refers to "User Identity" (git/vcs config) in `MenvConfig`/`VcsIdentityConfig`, but also "Application Configuration" (dotfiles) in `app_ctx.config_deployer`.
  2. "Create" is overloaded. `menv create` provisions a full environment (complex, multi-step), while `menv config create` copies default configuration files (simple deployment).

impact: |
  - **Confusion**: Users may run the wrong command or misunderstand what "config" refers to.
  - **Code Clarity**: Developers struggle to distinguish between identity management and dotfile deployment.

desired_outcome: |
  - Rename "User Identity" components to clearly distinguish them from "Configuration" (dotfiles). E.g., `IdentityConfig`, `IdentityStorage`.
  - Rename `menv config` commands to reflect their purpose (e.g., `menv identity`).
  - Rename `menv config create` to something more descriptive like `menv config deploy` or `menv config init`.
  - Ensure consistent usage of "create" vs "deploy" vs "provision".

  - "src/menv/services/config_storage.py"
  - "src/menv/commands/config.py"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "Config related to identity is clearly named (e.g., IdentityConfig)."
  - "Config related to dotfiles is clearly named (e.g., RoleConfig)."
  - "CLI commands are intuitive and distinct."

verification_commands:
  - "menv --help" # Check command names
  - "grep -r 'Config' src/menv/models/" # Check code terminology
