title: "Terminology Inconsistency (Config, Create/Deploy)"
label: "refacts"
priority: "low"
summary: "Terminology collisions ('config') and mismatches ('create' vs 'deploy') cause confusion."

# Content
problem: |
  The term "config" is overloaded in the codebase. It refers to both:
  1. User identity/VCS configuration (`VcsIdentityConfig`, managed by `ConfigStorage`).
  2. Ansible role configuration files (managed by `ConfigDeployer`).

  Additionally, the CLI command `menv config create` calls the service method `deploy_role`. This disconnect between the user-facing verb ("create") and the internal verb ("deploy") creates cognitive dissonance.

impact: |
  - **Cognitive Load:** Developers must mentally context-switch to understand which "config" is being referred to.
  - **Inconsistency:** The code doesn't match the ubiquitous language of the domain.

desired_outcome: |
  - Renaming one or both "config" concepts to be distinct (e.g., `IdentityConfig` vs `RoleConfig`).
  - Aligning CLI and Service verbs (e.g., rename `deploy_role` to `create_role_config` or similar, or change CLI to `deploy`).
