title: "Unsafe Resource Cleanup in AnsiblePaths"
statement: |
  The AnsiblePaths service uses `__del__` for resource cleanup, which is unreliable and can lead to resource leaks or errors during interpreter shutdown.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_paths.py"
    loc:
      - "42-48"
    note: "Use of __del__ to exit context manager."
