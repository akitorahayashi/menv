# Content
title: "Implementation of `llm` alias contradicts documented intent in Memory"
statement: |
  The `llm` shell alias is implemented to symlink `AGENTS.md` to `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, but workstation memory explicitly states it was updated to symlink `README.md`.
  This indicates a potential regression, a missed update, or an error in the memory record.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/ansible/roles/shell/config/common/alias/llm/llm.sh"
    loc:
      - "21"
    note: "Explicitly symlinks `../AGENTS.md` to `.claude/CLAUDE.md`."
  - path: ".jules/workstreams/generic/workstations/consistency/perspective.yml"
    loc:
      - "implicit"
    note: "Workstation memory (provided as context) claims the update targeted `README.md`."
