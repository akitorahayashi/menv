# Content
title: "Redundant Definition of Local Config Path"
statement: |
  The path `~/.config/menv/roles` is hardcoded in both `AnsibleRunner` and `ConfigDeployer`, violating Single Source of Truth. If the path changes, both services require modification.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
      - "line 39"
    note: "Hardcodes `local_config_root`."

  - path: "src/menv/services/config_deployer.py"
    loc:
      - "line 27"
    note: "Hardcodes `_local_config_root`."
