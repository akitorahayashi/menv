# Content
title: "Coverage Blindness: No Infrastructure"
statement: |
  The project completely lacks coverage measurement infrastructure, rendering it blind to testing gaps. No coverage is collected during local development or CI pipelines.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "pyproject.toml"
    loc:
      - "dependency-groups.dev"
    note: "Missing pytest-cov dependency and configuration."
  - path: "justfile"
    loc:
      - "unit-test"
      - "intg-test"
    note: "Test recipes execute pytest without coverage flags (--cov)."
  - path: ".github/workflows/lint-and-test.yml"
    loc:
      - "Run tests"
    note: "CI pipeline runs 'just test' but collects no coverage artifacts."
