title: "Duplicate Definition of Configuration Path"
statement: |
  The user configuration root path `~/.config/menv` is defined redundantly in at least three different services without a shared constant or configuration object.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_storage.py"
    loc:
      - "ConfigStorage.__init__"
    note: "Defines default config_dir path."
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_deployer.py"
    loc:
      - "ConfigDeployer.__init__"
    note: "Defines _local_config_root path independently."
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
      - "AnsibleRunner.run_playbook"
    note: "Defines local_config_root path independently."
