# Content
title: "Business Logic Leaking into CLI Command"
statement: |
  The `make` command contains private methods implementing core business logic (role resolution and configuration deployment), violating separation of concerns and making this logic unavailable to other parts of the application.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "33-66"
    note: "Methods `_get_roles_for_tags` and `_deploy_configs_for_roles` implement business logic inside the command layer."
