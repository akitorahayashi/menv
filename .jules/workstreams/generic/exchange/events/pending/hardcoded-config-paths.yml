# Content
title: "Hardcoded configuration paths violate Single Source of Truth"
statement: |
  The local configuration root path (~/.config/menv) is hardcoded redundantly in both ConfigStorage and ConfigDeployer services. This creates maintenance overhead and potential for inconsistency if one definition is changed without the other.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_storage.py"
    loc:
      - "__init__"
    note: "Hardcodes default path to Path.home() / '.config' / 'menv'."
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_deployer.py"
    loc:
      - "__init__"
    note: "Hardcodes local_config_root to Path.home() / '.config' / 'menv' / 'roles'."
