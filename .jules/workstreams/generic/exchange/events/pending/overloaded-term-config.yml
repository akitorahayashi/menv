title: "Term 'config' Overloaded for Identity and Ansible Roles"
statement: |
  The term 'config' is architecturally overloaded, referring to both user identity configuration (managed by ConfigStorage) and Ansible role configuration files (managed by ConfigDeployer).

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_storage.py"
    loc: "class ConfigStorage"
    note: "Manages identity configuration (name/email) in ~/.config/menv/config.toml"
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_deployer.py"
    loc: "class ConfigDeployer"
    note: "Manages role configuration files in ~/.config/menv/roles/"
