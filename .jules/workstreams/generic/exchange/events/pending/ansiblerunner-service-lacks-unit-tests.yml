# Content
title: "AnsibleRunner Service Lacks Unit Tests"
statement: |
  The `AnsibleRunner` service, which handles playbook execution, has no dedicated unit tests in `tests/unit/services/`, leaving a critical logic gap unverified.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "Service implementation exists"
  - path: "tests/unit/services/"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "No test file for AnsibleRunner found (expected test_ansible_runner.py)"
