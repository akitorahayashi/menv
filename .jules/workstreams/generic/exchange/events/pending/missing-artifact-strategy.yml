# Content
title: "CI validates source but fails to promote immutable artifacts"
statement: |
  The current pipeline runs tests and setup scripts against the source code but does not build or publish a versioned artifact (e.g., Wheel, PEX), meaning deployment relies on a potentially different checkout than what was tested.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/ci-workflows.yml"
    loc:
      - "jobs: [lint-and-test, setup-python, ...]"
    note: "Orchestrates testing/setup but lacks build/publish steps"
