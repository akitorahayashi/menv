title: "Low Coverage in User-Facing CLI Commands"
statement: |
  Several key CLI commands (`update`, `switch`, `create`) have dangerously low test coverage (< 35%). This exposes the application to regressions in user interactions, particularly in the self-update and environment switching workflows.
