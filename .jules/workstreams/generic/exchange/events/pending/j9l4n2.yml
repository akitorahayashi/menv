title: "Shadowed and Untested Backup Command Implementation"
statement: |
  `src/menv/commands/backup.py` is shadowed by the `src/menv/commands/backup/` package and contains untested, likely duplicate code (0% coverage).
  The CLI appears to use `src/menv/commands/backup/command.py` instead.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/backup.py"
    loc:
      - "3-152"
    note: "Entire file is uncovered and shadowed by the package structure."
  - path: "src/menv/commands/backup/__init__.py"
    loc:
      - "1-5"
    note: "Package init imports from `command.py`, bypassing `backup.py`."

  - "dead-code"
