# Content
title: "Application Logic Misplaced in Ansible Scripts"
statement: |
  Python application logic (e.g., backup functionality) is located in `src/menv/ansible/scripts/`, disconnecting it from the core application structure and hiding it from standard discovery and testing workflows.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/ansible/scripts/system/backup-system.py"
    loc:
      - "1-140"
    note: "Entire file is Python application logic for backing up system settings, placed in Ansible scripts directory."
