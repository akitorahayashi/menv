# Content
title: "Domain Data Leaking into CLI"
statement: |
  Domain concepts `TAG_GROUPS` (role aggregation) and `VALID_PROFILES` (execution targets) are defined in the CLI layer `commands/make.py` instead of the service layer. This violates Boundary Sovereignty, making the domain model dependent on the CLI implementation and preventing reusability in other interfaces.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "lines 17-23"
    note: "Defines `TAG_GROUPS`."
