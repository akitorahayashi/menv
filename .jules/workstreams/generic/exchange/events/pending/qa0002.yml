title: "Absence of Ansible Runtime Verification"
statement: |
  The test suite relies entirely on static validation of Ansible resources (YAML schema, file existence via Mirror Logic). There are no integration tests that execute `ansible-playbook` (even in `--check` mode or against a dummy target), leaving the system vulnerable to runtime errors (e.g., invalid module parameters, logic errors in tasks) that pass static schema checks.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "tests/intg/"
    loc:
      - "test_role_integrity.py"
      - "test_playbook_integrity.py"
    note: "Tests in this directory perform static analysis only, never invoking the ansible-playbook executable."
