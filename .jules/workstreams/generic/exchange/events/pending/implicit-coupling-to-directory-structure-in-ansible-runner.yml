# Content
title: "Implicit Coupling to Directory Structure in AnsibleRunner"
statement: |
  `AnsibleRunner` enforces an implicit directory structure for configuration files via the `local_config_root` variable, creating a hidden contract between the Python service and Ansible roles.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
      - "38"
    note: "Hardcoded path construction for `local_config_root` which is passed to Ansible."
