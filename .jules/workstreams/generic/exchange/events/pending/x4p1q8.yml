title: "Redundant Definition of Local Configuration Path"
statement: |
  The local configuration root path is hardcoded in multiple services, violating the Single Source of Truth principle and creating maintenance fragility.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
      - "39"
    note: "local_config_root defined as hardcoded path."
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_deployer.py"
    loc:
      - "26"
    note: "Same path hardcoded here."
