# Content
title: "Ambiguous Usage of 'Config' Terminology"
statement: |
  The term "Config" is overloaded to mean both "User Identity" (git/vcs config) and "Application Configuration" (dotfiles). `MenvConfig` and `VcsIdentityConfig` in `src/menv/models/config.py` refer solely to identity, while `app_ctx.config_deployer` manages dotfiles. This ambiguity creates confusion about the scope and responsibility of "config" related components.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/models/config.py"
    loc:
      - "17-21"
    note: "MenvConfig defined as VcsIdentityConfig container (Identity)"

  - path: "src/menv/commands/backup/command.py"
    loc:
      - "87"
    note: "local_config_dir variable used to refer to dotfiles configuration"

  - path: "src/menv/commands/config.py"
    loc:
      - "11"
    note: "MenvConfig imported but 'config create' refers to dotfiles deployment"
