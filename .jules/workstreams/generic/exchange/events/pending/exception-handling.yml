# Content
title: "Swallowed exceptions and unsafe FS operations in core services"
statement: |
  AnsibleRunner swallows FileNotFoundError (printing error instead of raising), and ConfigDeployer performs file system operations without exception handling, allowing raw OSError to crash the application. This violates the 'Exceptions are part of the API' principle.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
      - "88-94"
    note: "FileNotFoundError is caught, printed, and suppressed, returning exit code 1 instead of raising."
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_deployer.py"
    loc:
      - "80-94"
    note: "shutil.copytree and rmtree called without try/except blocks, risking unhandled OSError."
