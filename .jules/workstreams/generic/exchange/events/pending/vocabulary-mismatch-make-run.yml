title: "Vocabulary Mismatch between CLI 'make' and Service 'run'"
statement: |
  There is a vocabulary mismatch between the CLI command `menv make` and the internal service terminology `AnsibleRunner.run_playbook`. The CLI uses 'make' while the domain logic uses 'run'.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "def make"
    note: "CLI command defined as 'make'"
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
      - "def run_playbook"
    note: "Internal service method defined as 'run_playbook'"
