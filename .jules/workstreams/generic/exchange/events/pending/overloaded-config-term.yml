title: "Overloaded 'config' terminology"
statement: |
  The term "config" is architecturally overloaded, referring to both User Identity (managed by `ConfigStorage`) and Ansible Role Configurations (managed by `ConfigDeployer`). This ambiguity affects the CLI (`menv config` vs `menv make` deployment) and internal service naming.
