title: "Backup Logic Duplication and Dead Code"
statement: |
  The `backup` command logic is duplicated between `src/menv/commands/backup.py` (which invokes scripts via subprocess) and `src/menv/commands/backup/command.py` (which invokes services). Additionally, the core backup logic is duplicated between `src/menv/ansible/scripts/system/backup-system.py` and `src/menv/commands/backup/services/system.py`.
