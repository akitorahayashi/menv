title: "Critical Coverage Gap in AnsibleRunner"
statement: |
  The AnsibleRunner service, which is central to the application's core function of executing playbooks, has only 28% test coverage. The actual execution logic (`run_playbook`) is almost entirely skipped in tests due to reliance on mocks, leaving error handling and process execution unverified.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
      - "35-95"
    note: "Core `run_playbook` implementation is uncovered."
