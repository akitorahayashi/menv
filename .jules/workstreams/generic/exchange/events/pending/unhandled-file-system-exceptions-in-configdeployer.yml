title: "Unhandled File System Exceptions in ConfigDeployer"
statement: |
  The `ConfigDeployer` service and its tests do not account for potential `OSError` (e.g., permission denied) during file operations, posing a crash risk.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_deployer.py"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "Uses shutil.copytree/rmtree without explicit error handling"
  - path: "tests/unit/services/test_config_deployer.py"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "No tests for OSError/permission denied scenarios"
