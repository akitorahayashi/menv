# Content
title: "Deprecated `src/menv/commands/backup.py` file persists alongside new package"
statement: |
  The file `src/menv/commands/backup.py` exists as a deprecated artifact that duplicates and conflicts with the active `src/menv/commands/backup/` package implementation.
  The package structure (directory with `__init__.py`) is the active implementation, while the standalone file is dead code.
