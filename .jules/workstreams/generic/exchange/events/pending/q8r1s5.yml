title: "Absence of Automated Artifact Release Workflow"
statement: |
  The repository lacks a CI workflow to build and publish release artifacts (e.g., Python wheels, sdist) to GitHub Releases or PyPI. This relies on manual processes which lack provenance and traceability.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows"
    loc:
      - "dir"
    note: "absence of release.yml"

tags:
  - "automation"
  - "artifacts"
