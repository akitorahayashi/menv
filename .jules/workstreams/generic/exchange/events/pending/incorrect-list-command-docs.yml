title: "`list_tags` docstring contradicts CLI registration"
statement: |
  The `list_tags` function in `src/menv/commands/make.py` documents its usage as `menv make list`, but it is registered as a top-level command `menv list` in `src/menv/main.py`. The `menv make` command does not appear to support `list` as a subcommand or tag.
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "64-68"
    note: "Docstring shows `menv make list`."
  - path: "src/menv/main.py"
    loc:
      - "92-94"
    note: "Registered as `app.command(name='list')` (top-level)."
