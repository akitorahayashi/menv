# Content
title: "Manual TOML generation in ConfigStorage violates hygiene"
statement: |
  The ConfigStorage service manually constructs TOML strings instead of using a serialization library like `tomli-w`. This approach is fragile, prone to escaping errors (reinventing wheel), and makes the code harder to maintain compared to using a dedicated library.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_storage.py"
    loc:
      - "56-72"
    note: "Manual string construction and escaping logic for TOML generation."
