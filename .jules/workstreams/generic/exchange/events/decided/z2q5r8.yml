# Content
title: "Active `aider` feature is undocumented in user-facing README"
statement: |
  The `aider` integration is fully implemented in the codebase (available via `menv make aider` or `menv create` phase 5), but omitted from the `README.md` usage section.
  Other similar tools like `ollama` and `coder` are explicitly documented.
