# Content
title: "Vocabulary Mismatch: CLI 'create' vs Internal 'deploy'"
statement: |
  The user-facing CLI command `menv config create` maps to the internal service method `ConfigDeployer.deploy_role`.
  "Create" implies generating new content, whereas "Deploy" implies copying/installing existing content to a target.
  The internal naming "deploy" more accurately reflects the operation (copying config files), making the CLI term "create" misleading.

# Evidence supporting the observation

  - path: "src/menv/commands/config.py"
    loc:
      - "def create_config("
    note: "CLI command defined as 'create'"
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_deployer.py"
    loc:
      - "def deploy_role("
    note: "Internal service method named 'deploy_role'"
  - path: "src/menv/commands/config.py"
