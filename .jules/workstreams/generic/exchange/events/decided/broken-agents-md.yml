# Content
title: "Root AGENTS.md contains invalid relative links"
statement: |
  The AGENTS.md file in the root directory appears to be misplaced or copied incorrectly.
  It references a "root AGENTS.md" at `../../../../AGENTS.md` (which is impossible from root)
  and `src/AGENTS.md` (which does not exist). It also describes the `.jules` scaffold,
  duplicating content likely meant for `.jules/README.md`.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "3"
    note: "Link `../../../../AGENTS.md` is invalid from root."

  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "106"
    note: "Link `src/AGENTS.md` points to a non-existent file."
