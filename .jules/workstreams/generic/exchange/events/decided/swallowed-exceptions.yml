# Content
title: "Systemic Exception Swallowing in Core Services"
statement: |
  Multiple core services (`AnsibleRunner`, `VersionChecker`, `AnsiblePaths`) catch broad exceptions (e.g., `Exception`, `OSError`, `FileNotFoundError`) and return default values or exit codes instead of raising meaningful exceptions. This masks the root cause of failures, prevents callers from handling specific error cases, and mixes I/O (logging) with business logic.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
      - "87-92"
    note: "Catches FileNotFoundError and returns 1, masking the missing executable error."
  - path: "src/menv/services/version_checker.py"
    loc:
      - "43-44"
    note: "Catches (httpx.HTTPError, KeyError, ValueError) and returns None, hiding network/parsing issues."
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_paths.py"
    loc:
      - "47-48"
    note: "Catches Exception and passes in __del__, potentially hiding resource cleanup failures."
