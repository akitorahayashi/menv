title: "Domain logic (Tag Groups and Profiles) leaking into CLI layer"
statement: |
  The 'make' command defines 'TAG_GROUPS' and 'VALID_PROFILES' directly in the CLI module. These are core domain concepts defining valid environments and tag relationships, and should reside in the service or data model layer to ensure Boundary Sovereignty.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "TAG_GROUPS"
      - "VALID_PROFILES"
    note: "Constants defining domain rules are hardcoded in the command interface layer."

tags:
  - "boundary-sovereignty"
  - "coupling"
