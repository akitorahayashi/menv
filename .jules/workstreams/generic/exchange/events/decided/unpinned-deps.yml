title: "Unpinned toolchains and dependencies in CI"
statement: |
  Critical CI components use floating tags or 'latest' versions, creating supply chain risks and non-deterministic builds.
  GitHub Actions references are pinned to mutable tags (v4, v5) instead of SHAs.
  Homebrew installations use implicit 'latest'.

evidence:
  - path: ".github/actions/setup-base/action.yml"
    loc:
      - "uses: actions/setup-python@v5"
      - "uses: extractions/setup-just@v2"
      - "uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5"
    note: "Actions pinned to mutable tags allow upstream supply chain attacks."

  - path: ".github/workflows/lint-and-test.yml"
    loc:
      - "run: brew install shellcheck shfmt"
    note: "Implicit 'latest' from Homebrew means linting rules can change unexpectedly."

  - "security"
  - "reproducibility"
