title: "Ambiguous Module Structure for Backup Command"
statement: |
  The repository contains both `src/menv/commands/backup.py` and `src/menv/commands/backup/` package. This violates the "1 command per file" (or "1 domain per package") clarity and introduces potential import confusion. The package `backup/` appears to be the active implementation, while `backup.py` is likely dead code or redundant.
