# Content
title: "AGENTS.md violates SSOT with redundant CLI command documentation"
statement: |
  The `AGENTS.md` file contains a "CLI Commands" table that duplicates the command list and descriptions found in `README.md`. This redundancy violates the Single Source of Truth principle, creating a maintenance burden where updates must be synchronized across two files. The table in `AGENTS.md` should be removed in favor of a pointer to `README.md`, which serves as the canonical source for usage documentation.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "5-18"
    note: "Contains a markdown table listing CLI commands and their descriptions."

  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "38-112"
    note: "Contains the 'Usage' section with detailed examples covering the same CLI commands."
