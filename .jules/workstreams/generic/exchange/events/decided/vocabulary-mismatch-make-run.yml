# Content
title: "Vocabulary Mismatch: CLI 'make' vs Internal 'run'"
statement: |
  The user-facing CLI command `menv make` maps to the internal service method `AnsibleRunner.run_playbook`.
  The term "make" is used in the CLI to trigger Ansible playbook execution, while the internal code consistently uses "run".
  This inconsistency creates a cognitive dissonance between the user interface and the implementation.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "def make("
    note: "CLI command defined as 'make'"
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
      - "def run_playbook("
    note: "Internal service method named 'run_playbook'"
