title: Swallowed exceptions and unsafe FS operations in core services
statement: 'AnsibleRunner swallows FileNotFoundError (printing error instead of raising),
  and ConfigDeployer performs file system operations without exception handling, allowing
  raw OSError to crash the application. This violates the ''Exceptions are part of
  the API'' principle.

  '
evidence:
- path: src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py
  loc:
  - 88-94
  note: FileNotFoundError is caught, printed, and suppressed, returning exit code
    1 instead of raising.
- path: src/menv/services/config_deployer.py
  loc:
  - 80-94
  note: shutil.copytree and rmtree called without try/except blocks, risking unhandled
    OSError.
