title: "Missing immutable artifact promotion pipeline"
statement: |
  The project relies on users installing directly from git source (`pipx install git+...`), bypassing artifact versioning and integrity checks.
  There is no automated release workflow to build, sign, and publish wheels/sdists to GitHub Releases or PyPI.

evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "pipx install git+https://github.com/akitorahayashi/menv.git"
    note: "Installation instructions direct users to mutable git references."

  - path: ".github/workflows/"
    loc:
      - "ci-workflows.yml"
    note: "No release or publish workflow exists in the CI directory."
