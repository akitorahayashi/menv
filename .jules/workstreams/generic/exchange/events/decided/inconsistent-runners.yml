# Content
title: "Inconsistent macOS runner versions undermine reproducibility"
statement: |
  The CI pipeline mixes `macos-latest` and `macos-15`, creating a risk where "latest" drifts to a newer OS version that behaves differently from the explicitly pinned version, leading to irreproducible failures.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/lint-and-test.yml"
    loc:
      - "runs-on: macos-latest"
    note: "Uses floating macos-latest tag"

  - path: ".github/workflows/setup-python.yml"
    loc:
      - "runs-on: macos-15"
    note: "Uses specific macos-15 version, inconsistent with lint-and-test"

tags:
  - "reproducibility"
  - "ci"
  - "drift"
