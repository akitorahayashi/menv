# Content
title: "Inconsistent Semantics of 'create' Verb"
statement: |
  The verb "create" is used with significantly different meanings in the CLI. `menv create` provisions a full environment (idempotent, complex), while `menv config create` copies default configuration files (scaffolding/deployment). This overload dilutes the meaning of "create" and confuses users about the scope of the command.
