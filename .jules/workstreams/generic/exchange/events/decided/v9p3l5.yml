title: "Terminology Mismatch: 'Create' vs 'Deploy'"
statement: |
  The CLI command `menv config create` uses the verb "create", while the underlying service method is named `deploy_role`, causing a disconnect between user-facing and internal terminology.
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/config.py"
    loc:
      - "@config_app.command(name='create')"
    note: "CLI exposes the action as 'create'."
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_deployer.py"
    loc:
      - "def deploy_role(self, role: str, overwrite: bool = False) -> DeployResult:"
    note: "Service implements the action as 'deploy'."
