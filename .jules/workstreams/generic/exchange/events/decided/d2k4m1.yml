title: "Domain Constants Leakage"
statement: |
  Domain constants `VALID_PROFILES` and `PROFILE_ALIASES` are duplicated in multiple CLI command modules instead of being defined in a shared domain model.
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/create.py"
    loc:
      - "VALID_PROFILES = {...}"
      - "PROFILE_ALIASES = {...}"
    note: "Constants defined locally in create command."
  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "VALID_PROFILES = {...}"
      - "PROFILE_ALIASES = {...}"
    note: "Constants duplicated locally in make command."
