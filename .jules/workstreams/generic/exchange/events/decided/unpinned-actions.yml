# Content
title: "Unpinned GitHub Actions expose supply chain risk"
statement: |
  GitHub Actions are referenced by mutable tags (e.g., v4, v5) instead of immutable commit SHAs, allowing upstream changes to inject malicious code or break builds without warning.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/lint-and-test.yml"
    loc:
      - "uses: actions/checkout@v4"
    note: "Uses mutable tag @v4 instead of SHA"

  - path: ".github/actions/setup-base/action.yml"
    loc:
      - "uses: actions/setup-python@v5"
      - "uses: extractions/setup-just@v2"
      - "uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5"
    note: "Uses mutable tags @v5, @v2 instead of SHAs"

tags:
  - "security"
  - "supply-chain"
  - "reproducibility"
