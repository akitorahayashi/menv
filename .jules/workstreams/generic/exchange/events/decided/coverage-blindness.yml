title: 'Coverage Blindness: No Infrastructure'
statement: 'The project completely lacks coverage measurement infrastructure, rendering
  it blind to testing gaps. No coverage is collected during local development or CI
  pipelines.

  '
evidence:
- path: pyproject.toml
  loc:
  - dependency-groups.dev
  note: Missing pytest-cov dependency and configuration.
- path: justfile
  loc:
  - unit-test
  - intg-test
  note: Test recipes execute pytest without coverage flags (--cov).
- path: .github/workflows/lint-and-test.yml
  loc:
  - Run tests
  note: CI pipeline runs 'just test' but collects no coverage artifacts.
