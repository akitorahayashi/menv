title: "Critical Coverage Gap in AnsibleRunner"
statement: |
  The AnsibleRunner service, responsible for executing Ansible playbooks, has critically low coverage (28%).
  Core logic in `run_playbook`, including command construction, process execution, and error handling, is currently untested.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
      - "35-95"
    note: "Core execution logic and error handling are uncovered."
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
