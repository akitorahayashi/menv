title: "Exception swallowing in AnsibleRunner"
statement: |
  `AnsibleRunner.run_playbook` catches `FileNotFoundError` and returns an integer exit code (1).
  This swallows the exception and prevents callers from programmatically distinguishing between "command not found" and other errors.
  It also prints to the console directly, mixing I/O with error handling.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
      - "87-92"
    note: "Catches FileNotFoundError, prints error, and returns 1, losing stack trace and exception type."
