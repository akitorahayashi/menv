title: "Redundant Domain Constants in CLI"
statement: |
  `VALID_PROFILES` and `PROFILE_ALIASES` are defined redundantly and inconsistently in `src/menv/commands/create.py` and `src/menv/commands/make.py`. Domain constants should be centralized in the service layer or a shared models module to ensure a Single Source of Truth.
