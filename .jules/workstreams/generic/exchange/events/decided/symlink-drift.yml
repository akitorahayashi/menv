# Content
title: "README.md claims no symlinks, but shell role creates them"
statement: |
  The README.md explicitly states that menv provisions dotfiles by copying them (no symlinks),
  but the implementation of the shell role uses `ansible.builtin.file` with `state: link`
  to create symlinks for .zprofile and .zshrc pointing to the config directory.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "48" # Approximate line number based on previous read
    note: "Text: 'menv provisions dotfiles by copying them into your home directory (no symlinks)...'"

  - path: "src/menv/ansible/roles/shell/tasks/main.yml"
    loc:
      - "2"
      - "8"
      - "40"
    note: "Tasks explicitly use `state: link`."
