title: AnsibleRunner mixes I/O with logic and lacks unit tests
statement: 'AnsibleRunner directly uses subprocess and os modules, mixing I/O with
  core logic. This tight coupling forces heavy mocking for tests, likely contributing
  to the complete absence of unit tests for this service.

  '
evidence:
- path: src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py
  loc:
  - '71'
  note: Direct usage of subprocess.Popen prevents easy mocking.
- path: tests/unit/services/
  loc:
  - .
  note: Missing test_ansible_runner.py indicates zero coverage for this service.
