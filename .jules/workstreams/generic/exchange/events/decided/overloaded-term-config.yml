# Content
title: "Overloaded Term: 'config'"
statement: |
  The term "config" is overloaded to refer to two distinct concepts:
  1. User Identity (Git name/email) managed by `ConfigStorage` and `menv config` command.
  2. Ansible Role Configuration files (dotfiles) managed by `ConfigDeployer` and `menv config create`.
  This violates the "One Concept, One Preferred Term" principle and creates ambiguity.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/config.py"
    loc:
      - "class VcsIdentityConfig(TypedDict):"
    note: "Refers to User Identity"
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_deployer.py"
    loc:
      - "class ConfigDeployer:"
    note: "Refers to Ansible Role Configuration (dotfiles)"
  - path: "src/menv/commands/config.py"
    loc:
      - "@config_app.command(name=\"create\")"
    note: "Command mixes both concepts under 'config' namespace"
