title: "README.md Incorrectly Claims Dotfiles Are Copied (No Symlinks)"
statement: |
  The README.md explicitly states that dotfiles are provisioned by copying them into the home directory (no symlinks). However, the implementation in the shell Ansible role uses `state: link`, creating symbolic links. This contradicts the documentation and misinforms users about how their environment is modified.
