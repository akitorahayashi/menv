# Content
title: "Misplaced Command: 'list' at root level"
statement: |
  The `list` command is exposed at the root level (`menv list`) but strictly lists tags for the `make` command (`menv make`).
  This violates command hierarchy expectations. It should likely be a subcommand of `make` (e.g., `menv make list`) or renamed to reflect the resource it lists (e.g., `menv tags`).

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "def list_tags(ctx: typer.Context) -> None:"
    note: "Function defined in make.py but registered as root command"
  - path: "src/menv/main.py"
    loc:
      - "app.command(name=\"list\", ...)(list_tags)"
    note: "Registered at root level"

tags:
  - "cli"
  - "command-structure"
