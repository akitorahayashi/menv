title: Hardcoded configuration paths in services violate centralization
statement: 'AnsibleRunner and ConfigDeployer services contain hardcoded paths to ~/.config/menv/roles,
  creating scattered environment reads and preventing centralized configuration management.
  This violates the ''Single Source of Truth'' principle and makes the code difficult
  to test or run in isolated environments.
