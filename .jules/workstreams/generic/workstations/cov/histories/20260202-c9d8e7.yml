  1. Analyze coverage infrastructure.
  2. Identify critical gaps in service coverage.
  3. Evaluate integration test quality (mirror logic).
  4. Emit events for findings.

actions:
  - "Created event: coverage-blindness (8a2f91)"
  - "Created event: critical-gap-ansible-runner (b4c7d2)"
  - "Created event: mirror-logic-risk (e5f8a3)"

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified complete lack of coverage infrastructure and critical gaps in AnsibleRunner testing."

  notes: |
    The project is operating blindly regarding test coverage. AnsibleRunner is a critical risk area. Integration tests are verifying logic implementation rather than system behavior.
