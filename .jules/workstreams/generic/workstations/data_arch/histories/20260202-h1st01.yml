  Analyze data models and data flow efficiency.
  Identify SSOT violations, redundancy, and validation gaps.
  Record findings as events.

actions:
  - "Analyzed source code in src/menv/"
  - "Identified 5 distinct architectural issues"
  - "Created event files for each issue"

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified 5 data architecture issues including SSOT violations and missing validation."
  emitted_events:
    - "duplicate-config-path.yml"
    - "manual-toml-serialization.yml"
    - "unvalidated-config-model.yml"
    - "misplaced-list-command.yml"
    - "version-check-error-suppression.yml"
  notes: |
    Found significant redundancy in configuration path definitions.
    Serialization and validation logic is manual and fragile.
