  1. Initialize workstation perspective.
  2. Analyze codebase for structural violations (backup logic, list command, config terminology, missing files).
  3. Emit events for findings.
  4. Update workstation history.

actions:
  - "Created perspective.yml"
  - "Analyzed src/menv/commands/backup.py and src/menv/ansible/scripts/"
  - "Analyzed src/menv/commands/make.py"
  - "Analyzed src/menv/services/"
  - "Checked src/menv/ansible/ for missing files"
  - "Created 4 pending events"

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified 4 structural/architectural issues including a broken feature."
  emitted_events:
    - "bkp001"
    - "lst001"
    - "cfg001"
    - "inf001"
  notes: |
    The backup feature is currently broken due to argument mismatch across the process boundary.
    The list command location is a minor structural violation but affects findability.
    The config terminology overload is a semantic architectural issue.
    The missing ansible.just is a concrete missing file issue.
