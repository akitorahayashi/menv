  1. Analyze codebase for structural issues focusing on dependency direction, cohesion, and boundaries.
  2. Create events for identified violations.
  3. Initialize workstation state.

actions:
  - "Analyzed src/menv/ansible/scripts/ and identified misplaced application logic."
  - "Analyzed src/menv/commands/make.py and identified business logic leakage."
  - "Analyzed src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py and identified implicit coupling."
  - "Created 3 event files."

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified 3 structural violations regarding misplaced logic and coupling."
  emitted_events:
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/application-logic-misplaced-in-ansible-scripts.yml"
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/business-logic-leaking-into-cli-command.yml"
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/implicit-coupling-to-directory-structure-in-ansible-runner.yml"
  notes: |
    Found significant architectural drift where core logic is hidden in scripts or leaked into CLI commands.
