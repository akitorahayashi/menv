goals:
  - "Centralize configuration and domain constants (SSOT) to remove duplication and CLI coupling."
  - "Refactor services to raise typed exceptions instead of swallowing errors."
  - "Replace manual TOML generation in ConfigStorage with a proper library."
  - "Refactor `backup` command to use a dedicated service and remove direct subprocess calls."

rules:
  - "Services must not print to stdout/stderr; return data or raise exceptions."
  - "Exceptions must preserve context; avoid bare returns on failure."
  - "Configuration paths must be defined in one place (AppContext or Config service)."
