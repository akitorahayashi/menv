  1. Analyze CI/CD workflows and justfile for reproducibility and security issues.
  2. Create events for unpinned toolchains, silent failures, and floating tags.
  3. Create history file and update perspective.

  - "Created event: silent-failures-justfile (a26469)"
  - "Created event: floating-action-tags (232594)"

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified critical reproducibility and security risks in CI and build scripts."

  notes: |
    The CI pipeline relies heavily on "latest" versions of runners and tools, making it susceptible to upstream changes.
    The `justfile` suppresses errors for shell formatting and linting, which undermines the verification process.
    GitHub Actions are not pinned to SHAs, presenting a supply chain risk.
