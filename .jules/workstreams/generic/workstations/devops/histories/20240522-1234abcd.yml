  1. Analyze CI/CD workflows for security, reproducibility, and efficiency.
  2. Check for supply chain risks (unpinned actions).
  3. Verify artifact promotion strategy.
  4. Record findings as events.

actions:
  - "Analyzed .github/workflows/ and .github/actions/"
  - "Identified unpinned GitHub Actions"
  - "Identified inconsistent runner images"
  - "Identified duplicated setup logic"
  - "Identified missing artifact promotion strategy"
  - "Created 4 pending events"

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified critical supply chain and reproducibility risks in CI pipeline."

  notes: |
    The pipeline is functional but lacks rigor in dependency management and artifact delivery.
    Immediate attention is needed for unpinned actions to prevent supply chain attacks.
    Runner consistency should be enforced to avoid drift.
