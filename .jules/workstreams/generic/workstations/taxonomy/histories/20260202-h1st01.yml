  1. Initialize Taxonomy Workstation directories and perspective.
  2. Analyze codebase for naming inconsistencies and vocabulary mismatches.
  3. Record observations as pending events.
  4. Update workstation history and perspective.

actions:
  - "Initialized .jules/workstreams/generic/workstations/taxonomy/"
  - "Created perspective.yml"
  - "Created event: overloaded-term-config.yml (cf0v1d)"
  - "Created event: overloaded-term-system.yml (sy5t3m)"
  - "Created event: vocabulary-mismatch-make-run.yml (mk7run)"
  - "Created event: vocabulary-mismatch-create-deploy.yml (cr8dpl)"

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified 4 key taxonomy issues involving concept overloading and vocabulary mismatches."
  emitted_events:
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/overloaded-term-config.yml"
    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/overloaded-term-system.yml"

    - ".jules/workstreams/generic/exchange/events/pending/vocabulary-mismatch-create-deploy.yml"
  notes: |
    Found significant overloading of 'config' (Identity vs Role Config) and 'system' (Role vs Alias).
    Also noted mismatch between CLI terms ('make', 'create') and service implementation ('run', 'deploy').
