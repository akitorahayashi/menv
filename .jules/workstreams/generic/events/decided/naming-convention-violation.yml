title: "PlaybookService Violates Naming Conventions"
statement: |
  `AGENTS.md` mandates plain names without suffixes for services (e.g., `ConfigStorage`, not `ConfigStorageService`) and matching filenames. `PlaybookService` in `src/menv/services/playbook.py` violates both rules: it has a `Service` suffix and the filename `playbook.py` does not match the class name `PlaybookService` (should be `playbook_service.py` if following class name, or class should be `Playbook`).

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "Services"
    note: "Rule: 'Naming: Plain name without suffix', '1 class per file'"
  - path: "src/menv/services/playbook.py"
    loc:
      - "class PlaybookService"
    note: "Class name contains 'Service' suffix."
