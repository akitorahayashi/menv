title: "Inconsistent CLI command structure for list command"
statement: |
  The `list` command is implemented as `list_tags` in `src/menv/commands/make.py` instead of having its own file `src/menv/commands/list.py`. This violates the "1 command per file" rule and creates confusion about whether `list` is a top-level command or a subcommand of `make`. Additionally, documentation incorrectly suggests `menv mk list` is a valid command.

# Evidence supporting the observation
# For multi-file events, add multiple list items.
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "list_tags"
    note: "Function `list_tags` implements `list` command but is located in `make.py`."

  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "Examples"
    note: "Docstring suggests `menv mk list` which is invalid as `list` is not a tag."

  - path: "src/menv/main.py"
    loc:
      - "app.command(name=\"list\""
    note: "Registers `list` as a top-level command pointing to `list_tags` from `make` module."
