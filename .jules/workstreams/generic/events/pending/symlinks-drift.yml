# Content
title: "Symlink Usage Contradicts Documentation"
statement: |
  `README.md` explicitly states "no symlinks" are used for dotfiles to prevent pipx upgrade issues. However, the implementation in `src/menv/ansible/roles/shell/tasks/main.yml` and the architectural rules in `AGENTS.md` explicitly use and prescribe symlinks.

# Evidence supporting the observation
