title: "List Tags Docstring Error"
statement: |
  The docstring for `list_tags` in `src/menv/commands/make.py` provides incorrect usage examples (`menv make list`), implying `list` is a subcommand of `make`. However, `list` is registered as a top-level command (`menv list`) in `main.py`.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "list_tags"
    note: "Docstring claims usage: 'menv make list'."
  - path: "src/menv/main.py"
    loc:
      - "app.command(name=\"list\"..."
    note: "Registered as top-level 'list' command."
