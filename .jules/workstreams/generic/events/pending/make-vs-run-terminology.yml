title: "Make vs Run Terminology"
statement: |
  The CLI uses `menv make` to run tasks, while the codebase consistently uses "Run" (`AnsibleRunner`, `run_playbook`). The use of "make" is likely a historical artifact and is inconsistent with the internal domain language.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "make"
    note: "CLI command is 'make'."
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
      - "AnsibleRunner.run_playbook"
    note: "Service method is 'run_playbook'."
