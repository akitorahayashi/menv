title: "Phantom Introduce Command"
statement: |
  The `README.md` file references a `menv introduce` command, but no such command exists in the codebase (`main.py` or `commands/`). This is a "ghost name" that should be removed or implemented.

evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "menv introduce --help"
    note: "Documentation mentions this command."
  - path: "src/menv/main.py"
    loc:
      - "app"
    note: "Command is not registered here."
