# Content
title: "README contradicts existence of llm role profiles"
statement: |
  The README explicitly states that only the `brew` role has profile-specific configurations. However, the `llm` role also implements profile-specific configurations in `src/menv/ansible/roles/llm/config/profiles/`.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "Profile Design"
    note: "States: 'Only `brew` role has profile-specific configs (macbook/mac-mini)'"

  - path: "src/menv/ansible/roles/llm/config/profiles/mac-mini/models.yml"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "Existence of this file proves llm role uses profile-specific configs."
