title: "Dict-shaped configuration models"
statement: |
  The domain models `MenvConfig` and `VcsIdentityConfig` are implemented as `TypedDict` without validation,
  allowing invalid states and implicit defaults to propagate through the system.

    note: "Models defined as TypedDict, which are essentially dicts with type hints but no runtime validation."

    loc:
      - "49"
      - "53"
    note: "Values are extracted with `get(key, '')`, allowing empty strings for required fields like name/email."
