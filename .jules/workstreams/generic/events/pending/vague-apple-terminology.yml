title: "Vague Terminology: Apple vs MacOS"
statement: |
  The shell alias file `apple.sh` groups development tools (Xcode, Swift) under the vendor name "Apple", while system utilities are grouped under "MacOS" (`system/macos.sh`). This overlapping terminology violates "One Concept, One Preferred Term" and creates vague boundaries. "Apple" is too broad, and "MacOS" is used for Unix utilities rather than OS specifics.

    loc:
      - "alias sw=swift"
    note: "Contains Xcode and Swift aliases."
  - path: "src/menv/ansible/roles/shell/config/common/alias/system/macos.sh"
    loc:
      - "alias mkd=mkdir"
    note: "Contains generic Unix aliases."
