title: "Generic Service Name: PlaybookService"
statement: |
  The class `PlaybookService` in `src/menv/services/playbook.py` uses the generic suffix "Service" despite being a domain model wrapper/registry. This is inconsistent with other service names (e.g., `AnsibleRunner`, `ConfigDeployer`) which describe their specific function. Additionally, the filename `playbook.py` does not match the class name `PlaybookService` (expected `playbook_service.py` or class `Playbook`).

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/playbook.py"
    loc:
      - "class PlaybookService"
    note: "Class name includes generic 'Service' suffix."
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_runner.py"
    loc:
      - "class AnsibleRunner"
    note: "Other services use specific functional names."
