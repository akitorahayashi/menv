title: "Overloaded Terminology: System"
statement: |
  The term "system" is used for the Ansible role managing macOS defaults (`roles/system`) and simultaneously for a category of shell aliases (`roles/shell/config/common/alias/system`) containing general Unix utilities. This creates ambiguity about the boundary of "system" responsibilities and violates "One Concept, One Preferred Term".

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/ansible/roles/system"
    loc:
      - "tasks/main.yml"
    note: "Manages macOS defaults (Finder, Dock, etc.)."
  - path: "src/menv/ansible/roles/shell/config/common/alias/system"
    loc:
      - "macos.sh"
    note: "Contains general Unix utilities like cat, echo, mkdir."
