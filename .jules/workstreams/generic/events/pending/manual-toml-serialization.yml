title: "Manual TOML serialization in ConfigStorage"
statement: |
  The ConfigStorage service implements manual TOML serialization by string concatenation instead of using a reliable library (e.g., tomlkit). This is fragile, error-prone, and reinvents the wheel.
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_storage.py"
    loc:
      - "57-79"
    note: "save method manually constructs TOML string with basic escaping"

  - "python"
  - "anti-pattern"
