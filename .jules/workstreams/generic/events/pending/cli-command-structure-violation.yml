# Content
title: "CLI Command Structure Violation (list command)"
statement: |
  The `list` command logic is embedded in `make.py` as `list_tags` instead of having its own module `list.py`. This violates the 'One Command Per File' architecture and reduces findability.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "def list_tags"
    note: "Command logic defined as a function inside make.py instead of a separate module."
  - path: "src/menv/main.py"
    loc:
      - "menv.commands.make import list_tags"
      - "app.command(name='list'...)(list_tags)"
    note: "Command registration imports from make.py."
