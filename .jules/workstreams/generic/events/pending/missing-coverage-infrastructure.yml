description: Missing coverage infrastructure
type: risk
severity: high
context:
  - pyproject.toml
  - justfile
details: |
  The project lacks any code coverage configuration or tools.
  - No `pytest-cov` or `coverage` in `pyproject.toml` dependencies.
  - No `[tool.coverage.*]` configuration.
  - No `cov` recipe in `justfile`.
  This creates a risk of invisible regressions as new code is added without verification of test execution.
recommendation: |
  1. Add `pytest-cov` to dev dependencies.
  2. Configure `.coveragerc` or `[tool.coverage.run]` in `pyproject.toml`.
  3. Add a `just cov` recipe to run tests with coverage reporting.
