title: "Unsafe I/O in ConfigDeployer"
statement: |
  The `ConfigDeployer` service performs file system operations (copying trees, reading directories) without any exception handling. This allows raw `OSError` exceptions to propagate up to the CLI, causing crashes instead of controlled failures, and violates the principle that exceptions are part of the API.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_deployer.py"
    loc:
      - "deploy_role"
      - "roles_with_config"
    note: "Methods use shutil.copytree, shutil.rmtree, and Path.iterdir without try/except blocks, swallowing context and leaking implementation details."
