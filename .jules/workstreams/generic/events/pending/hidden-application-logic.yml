# Content
title: "Hidden Application Logic in Scripts"
statement: |
  Significant application logic (CLI wrappers, backup logic) exists in `src/menv/ansible/scripts/` instead of the main application structure. These scripts perform core business logic (e.g. `aider` CLI, system backup) but are disconnected from the main `menv` CLI and lack proper visibility.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/ansible/scripts/shell/aider.py"
    loc:
      - "class aider.py"
    note: "Full CLI application with argument parsing and subcommands hidden in ansible scripts."
  - path: "src/menv/ansible/scripts/system/backup-system.py"
    loc:
      - "def backup_settings"
    note: "Core system backup logic isolated in a script rather than a service/command."
