title: "Inefficient Sleep-based Orchestration"
statement: |
  The `jules-workflows.yml` workflow uses `sleep` to wait between agent layers (observers -> deciders -> planners -> implementers). This approach causes unnecessary runner idle time (cost/resource waste) and is fragile, as it relies on arbitrary wait times rather than event-driven triggers or polling completion status.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/jules-workflows.yml"
    loc:
      - "sleep $((WAIT_MINUTES * 60))"
    note: "Uses sleep to simulate async wait for next layer processing."
