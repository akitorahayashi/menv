title: "Unsafe resource cleanup in AnsiblePaths"
statement: |
  The AnsiblePaths service uses `__del__` for resource cleanup with a swallowed exception. This relies on the garbage collector which is not guaranteed to run, and the naked except block hides potential errors during cleanup.
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/ansible_paths.py"

      - "41-47"
    note: "__del__ implementation with `except Exception: pass`"
