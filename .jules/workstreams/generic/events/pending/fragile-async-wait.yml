# Content
title: "Fragile Async Wait in Jules Workflows"
statement: |
  The `jules-workflows.yml` uses fixed `sleep` durations to wait for asynchronous processing (e.g. `sleep $((WAIT_MINUTES * 60))`). This "sleep and pray" pattern is brittle: it causes failure if processing exceeds the window and wastes resources if processing finishes early.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/jules-workflows.yml"
    loc:
      - "sleep $((WAIT_MINUTES * 60))"
    note: "Uses blocking sleep to wait for async agent processing."
