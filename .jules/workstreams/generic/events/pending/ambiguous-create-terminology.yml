title: "Ambiguous Create Terminology"
statement: |
  The verb "create" is used for both environment provisioning (`menv create`) and configuration deployment (`menv config create`), confusing the user action and violating "User-facing vocabulary aligned with code-level terminology". Code uses "deploy" for the config action.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/create.py"
    loc:
      - "create"
    note: "Command to provision environment."
  - path: "src/menv/commands/config.py"
    loc:
      - "create_config"
    note: "Command to deploy config files."
  - path: "src/menv/services/config_deployer.py"
    loc:
      - "ConfigDeployer.deploy_role"
    note: "Code terminology is 'deploy'."
