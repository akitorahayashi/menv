title: "Command Structure Inconsistency: list in make.py"
statement: |
  The `list` command is implemented as `list_tags` inside `src/menv/commands/make.py`
  rather than in a dedicated file, violating the project's one-command-per-file convention.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "list_tags"
    note: "Function defined here."
  - path: "src/menv/main.py"
    loc:
      - "app.command(name=\"list\"..."
    note: "Command registered here pointing to menv.commands.make.list_tags."

tags:
  - "consistency"
  - "architecture"
