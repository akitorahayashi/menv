# Content
title: "Unpinned Toolchains and Floating Runner Tags"
statement: |
  CI workflows use floating tags for runners (`macos-latest`, `ubuntu-latest`) and unpinned package installations (`brew install shellcheck`), leading to potential non-determinism and reproducibility issues where builds may behave differently over time as underlying environments change.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/lint-and-test.yml"
    loc:
      - "runs-on: macos-latest"
    note: "Uses floating runner tag which changes over time."

  - path: ".github/workflows/lint-and-test.yml"
    loc:
      - "run: brew install shellcheck"
    note: "Installs latest shellcheck without pinning version."

  - path: ".github/workflows/jules-workflows.yml"
    loc:
      - "runs-on: ubuntu-latest"
    note: "Uses floating runner tag."

  - path: ".github/workflows/jules-workflows.yml"
    loc:
      - "version: ${{ vars.JLO_VERSION || 'latest' }}"
    note: "Defaults to 'latest' for jlo version if variable is unset."
