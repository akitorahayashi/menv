title: Missing Artifact Promotion Pipeline
description: >
  The current CI/CD pipeline runs tests and checks but does not produce immutable build artifacts (e.g., Python wheels, PEX binaries, or Docker images).
  Deployment relies on source code or implicit "latest" state, violating the "Ship artifacts, not scripts" principle.
  This makes it impossible to cryptographically verify what code is running in an environment or to rollback to a specific known-good binary.
evidence:
  - file: .github/workflows/ci-workflows.yml
    line: 1
    content: "name: MacOS Environment Setup CI Pipeline"
  - file: .github/workflows/ci-workflows.yml
    line: 11
    content: "uses: ./.github/workflows/lint-and-test.yml"
recommendation: >
  Implement a `build` job that produces a versioned Python Wheel (`.whl`) or PEX binary.
  Upload this artifact to GitHub Actions Artifacts or a package registry.
  Subsequent steps (e.g., release, deploy) should consume this exact artifact rather than checking out source code again.
