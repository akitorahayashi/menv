  The workflow `lint-and-test.yml` uses `macos-latest`, which resolves to different OS versions over time, causing potential non-determinism. Additionally, `jules-workflows.yml` uses `ubuntu-latest`, while other setup workflows use `macos-15`, creating inconsistency in the test environment.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/lint-and-test.yml"
    loc:
      - "runs-on: macos-latest"
    note: "Uses floating 'latest' tag which changes over time (e.g., from macos-12 to macos-14)."

  - path: ".github/workflows/jules-workflows.yml"
    loc:
      - "runs-on: ubuntu-latest"
    note: "Uses floating 'latest' tag for orchestration workflow."

  - path: ".github/workflows/setup-python.yml"
    loc:
      - "runs-on: macos-15"
    note: "Inconsistent with lint-and-test.yml (uses macos-15 vs macos-latest)."
