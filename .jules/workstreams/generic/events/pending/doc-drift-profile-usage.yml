title: "Documentation Drift: Profile Usage in llm role"
statement: |
  The documentation (`README.md` and `AGENTS.md`) explicitly states that only the `brew` role utilizes profile-specific configurations. However, the `llm` role implementation includes a `profiles/` directory with `models.yml`, indicating undisclosed profile support.

# Evidence supporting the observation
