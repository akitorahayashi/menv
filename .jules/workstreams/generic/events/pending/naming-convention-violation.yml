description: "PlaybookService violates AGENTS.md naming conventions (suffix usage and file naming)."
details: |
  **Documented Rules:**
  `AGENTS.md` requires:
  1. "Naming: Plain name without suffix (e.g., `ConfigStorage`)"
  2. Implicit requirement for file names to match class names (e.g., `services/config_storage.py` ↔ `ConfigStorage`).

  **Implemented Behavior:**
  `src/menv/services/playbook.py` contains the class `PlaybookService`.
  - Violates "no suffix" rule (contains `Service` suffix).
  - Violates file matching rule (`playbook.py` vs `PlaybookService`).

  **Impact:**
  Inconsistent service structure makes the codebase harder to navigate and automated tooling (or agents) harder to run reliably.
