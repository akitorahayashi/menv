# Content
title: "Business Logic Leak in Make Command"
statement: |
  The `make` command (`src/menv/commands/make.py`) contains hardcoded business logic for tag grouping (`TAG_GROUPS`) and profile validation (`VALID_PROFILES`). This violates Separation of Concerns, as business rules should reside in services or models, not in the CLI layer.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/make.py"
    loc:
      - "TAG_GROUPS = {...}"
      - "VALID_PROFILES = {...}"
    note: "Hardcoded dictionary definitions defining business rules."
