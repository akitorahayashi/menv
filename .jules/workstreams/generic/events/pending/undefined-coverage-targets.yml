description: Undefined coverage targets
type: risk
severity: medium
context:
  - pyproject.toml
details: |
  The project has no defined coverage targets (e.g., minimum line coverage percentage, branch coverage).
  Without explicit targets, there is no signal to prevent gradual degradation of test quality over time.
recommendation: |
  Once coverage infrastructure is in place, define minimum coverage thresholds in `pyproject.toml` or `.coveragerc`.
  Example:
  ```toml
  [tool.coverage.report]
  fail_under = 80
  ```
