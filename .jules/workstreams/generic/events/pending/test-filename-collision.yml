title: "Duplicate test filenames in role integration tests"
statement: |
  Test modules in `tests/intg/roles/` have duplicate filenames (`test_config.py`, `test_tools.py`), violating the naming convention requiring unique filenames (e.g., `test_<role>_config.py`) to prevent potential Pytest collisions and ambiguity.

# Evidence supporting the observation
# For multi-file events, add multiple list items.
