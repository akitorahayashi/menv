description: "AGENTS.md incorrectly claims only 'brew' role has profile-specific configs."
details: |
  **Documented Behavior:**
  `AGENTS.md` states: "Profile-specific configs: Only `brew` role has profile-specific configs (macbook/mac-mini)".

  **Implemented Behavior:**
  The `llm` role also uses profile-specific configurations, evidenced by the existence of `src/menv/ansible/roles/llm/config/profiles/mac-mini/`.

  **Impact:**
  Developers relying on `AGENTS.md` might assume only `brew` needs profile handling logic or that other roles are strictly common-only.
