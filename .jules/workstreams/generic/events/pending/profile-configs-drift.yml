# Content
title: "Profile-Specific Configs Used in Non-Brew Role"
statement: |
  `AGENTS.md` claims that only the `brew` role uses profile-specific configurations. However, the `llm` role also implements profile-specific configurations, as evidenced by the existence of `src/menv/ansible/roles/llm/config/profiles/`.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "Profile Design"
    note: "States: 'Only brew role has profile-specific configs'"
  - path: "src/menv/ansible/roles/llm/config/profiles/mac-mini/"
    note: "Directory exists, indicating profile-specific config usage in llm role."
