title: "menv create excludes Google Antigravity setup"
statement: "The `menv create` command omits the `antigravity` tag from its `FULL_SETUP_TAGS`, preventing Google Antigravity from being set up during full environment creation, despite being listed as a supported Editor in README.md."
evidence:
  - "src/menv/constants.py: FULL_SETUP_TAGS does not include 'antigravity'"
  - "README.md: Lists 'menv make antigravity' under Editors section alongside VSCode and Cursor"
tags: ["documentation", "create-command", "antigravity"]
