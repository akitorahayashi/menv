title: "Term Overload: 'Profile' used for both Machine Targets and Identity"
statement: |
  The term "Profile" is overloaded and ambiguous, referring to two distinct concepts:
  1. "Machine Target" (e.g., macbook, mac-mini) used in `menv create`.
  2. "User Identity" (e.g., personal, work) used in `menv switch`.
  This creates confusion (e.g., users might try to "switch" to a machine or "create" an identity).

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/constants.py"
    loc:
      - "MACHINE_PROFILES"
      - "PROFILE_ALIASES"
    note: "Defines 'Profile' as a machine target (e.g., 'macbook')."

  - path: "src/menv/commands/switch.py"
    loc:
      - "switch (command)"
      - "PROFILE_ALIASES (local constant)"
    note: "Defines 'Profile' as a user identity (e.g., 'personal')."

  - path: "src/menv/services/config_storage.py"
    loc:
      - "get_identity (method)"
    note: "Uses 'profile' argument to mean identity, clashing with domain constants."
