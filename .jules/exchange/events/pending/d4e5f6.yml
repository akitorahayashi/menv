title: "Tag Groups SSOT Violation"
statement: |
  `TAG_GROUPS` definitions are hardcoded in `menv.constants`, creating a split authority for tag definitions. While `playbook.yml` (via `Playbook` service) is the SSOT for tags, tag *aggregations* are externalized, causing coupling between CLI and constants.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/constants.py"
    loc:
      - "25-30"
    note: "`TAG_GROUPS` defines tag aggregations independently of the Playbook service."
