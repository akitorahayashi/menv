title: "Term Overload: 'Config' used for both Identity and Role Dotfiles"
statement: |
  The term "Config" is overloaded and ambiguous, referring to two distinct concepts:
  1. "User Identity" (Git name/email) managed via `menv config show/set` and `ConfigStorage`.
  2. "Role Configuration" (dotfiles/settings) managed via `menv config create` and `ConfigDeployer`.
  This violates the "One Concept, One Preferred Term" principle and confuses users about what `menv config` actually manages.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/config.py"
    loc:
      - "config_app (Typer app)"
      - "show_config (command)"
      - "create_config (command)"
    note: "The `config` command group mixes identity management (`show`, `set`) with dotfile deployment (`create`)."

  - path: "src/menv/services/config_storage.py"
    loc:
      - "ConfigStorage (class)"
      - "get_identity (method)"
    note: "`ConfigStorage` primarily manages identity profiles (personal/work) but is named generically."

  - path: "src/menv/services/config_deployer.py"
    loc:
      - "ConfigDeployer (class)"
      - "deploy_role (method)"
    note: "`ConfigDeployer` manages role configuration files, sharing the 'Config' name but unrelated to identity."
