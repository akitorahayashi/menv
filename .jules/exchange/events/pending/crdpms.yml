title: "Naming Mismatch: 'Create' vs 'Deploy' for Role Configs"
statement: |
  The CLI command `menv config create` uses the verb "Create" to describe deploying static configuration files, which clashes with the internal implementation `ConfigDeployer` and overloads the "Create" verb (also used for full machine provisioning).
  "Deploy" or "Install" is a more accurate term for copying files.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/config.py"
    loc:
      - "create_config (command)"
    note: "Command is named 'create', but docstring says 'Deploy role configs'."

  - path: "src/menv/services/config_deployer.py"
    loc:
      - "ConfigDeployer (class)"
      - "deploy_role (method)"
      - "DeployResult (class)"
    note: "Internal service uses 'Deploy' consistently, creating a mismatch with the CLI."
