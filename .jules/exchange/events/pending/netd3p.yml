# Content
title: "External Network Dependency in Integration Tests"
statement: |
  The test `tests/intg/test_checksums.py` performs live network requests to validate installer checksums,
  introducing flakiness and external dependencies into the test suite. This violates the "Isolation By Design"
  and "Determinism Over Retries" principles.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "tests/intg/test_checksums.py"
    loc:
      - "34-36"
    note: "httpx.Client().get(url) performs a real network request."
  - path: "tests/intg/installer_checksums.yml"
    loc:
      - "2-8"
    note: "Contains external URLs used in the test."
