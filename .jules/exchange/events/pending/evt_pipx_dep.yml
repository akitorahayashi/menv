title: "Hardcoded pipx Dependency in VersionChecker Service"
statement: |
  The `VersionChecker` service assumes the application is installed and managed via `pipx` by directly invoking `pipx upgrade menv`. This creates a tight coupling to a specific package manager in the service layer, preventing alternative installation methods (e.g., system package, dev setup, other venv managers) or requiring them to use `pipx` just for updates. The update mechanism should be abstracted or configurable.

evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/services/version_checker.py"
    snippet: |
      result = subprocess.run(
          ["pipx", "upgrade", "menv"],
          check=False,
      )
