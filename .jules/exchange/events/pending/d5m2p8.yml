# Content
title: "Dead Code Detected: Shadowed Backup Module"
statement: |
  The file `src/menv/commands/backup.py` is shadowed by the package `src/menv/commands/backup/` (containing `__init__.py` and `command.py`). The module file is never executed (0% coverage) and should be removed to eliminate redundancy and confusion.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/menv/commands/backup.py"
    loc:
      - "1-152"
    note: "File shows 0% coverage and is never imported or executed."
  - path: "src/menv/commands/backup/__init__.py"
    loc:
      - "1-6"
    note: "Package takes precedence over the module."
