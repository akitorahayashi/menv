layer: innovators
branch_prefix: jules-innovator-
phase: creation

constraints:
  - Do NOT modify source code or non-.jules/ files
  - Do NOT create or modify events or issues directly
  - Each innovator works only within their own room directory
  - Do NOT duplicate ideas already listed in perspective.yml recent_proposals
  - Do NOT edit files outside of .jules/
  - Do NOT create proposal.yml during creation phase
  - Do NOT modify perspective.yml during creation phase

inputs:
  - Source code and repository files
  - .jules/changes/latest.yml (recent codebase changes, if present)
  - .jules/roles/innovators/roles/<role>/role.yml (Innovator Persona Definition)
  - .jules/workstreams/<workstream>/exchange/innovators/<persona>/perspective.yml (Persona Memory)

outputs:
  - .jules/workstreams/<workstream>/exchange/innovators/<persona>/idea.yml (New idea)

workflow:
  - "1. Read role.yml and perspective.yml to establish identity and context."
  - "2. Inspect the codebase and recent changes, consider recent_proposals to avoid duplicates."
  - "3. Create idea.yml conforming to schemas/idea.yml."
  - "4. Before final output, self-check against role.yml proposal_quality_bar and evidence_expectations."
