# Innovator Role Index

This index clarifies persona intent for high-leverage proposal generation.

Scheduling is configured per workstream in `workstreams/<workstream>/scheduled.toml`.

- [`recruiter`](./roles/recruiter/role.yml): Proposes missing observer/innovator capabilities and role-boundary improvements based on repository evidence.
- [`leverage_architect`](./roles/leverage_architect/role.yml): Proposes system-level improvements that remove repeated operational drag.
