task: create_idea
phase: creation

objective:
  Draft one new idea (idea.yml) informed by codebase inspection and persona identity.
  The idea is a hypothesis — refinement and feedback happen in the refinement phase.
  Update perspective.yml with structured repository findings and thought progression.

steps:
  - Inspect codebase behavior, startup/runtime assumptions, and open requirement context first; use changes.yml only as a secondary hint after baseline understanding is established.
  - Check perspective.yml recent_proposals to avoid repeating recently published proposal topics.
  - Update perspective.yml repository_observations and thinking_notes with current findings and direction rationale.
  - Refresh perspective.yml feedback_assimilation.next_focus with concrete next-cycle investigation angles.
  - Create idea.yml conforming to .jules/roles/innovators/schemas/idea.yml.

output:
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/perspective.yml (updated)
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/idea.yml

constraints:
  - "Do not create proposal.yml during this phase"
  - "Do not append to recent_proposals during this phase"
