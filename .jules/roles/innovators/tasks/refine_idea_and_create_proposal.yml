task: refine_idea_and_create_proposal
phase: refinement

objective:
  Refine the drafted idea into a finished proposal informed by observer feedback.
  Evaluate feasibility, impact, and risks, then produce proposal.yml meeting
  the quality bar defined in role.yml.

steps:
  - Read all feedback files in .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/comments/*.yml.
  - Re-check repository code behavior and runtime assumptions for claim validity before finalizing proposal.
  - Update perspective.yml feedback_assimilation.observer_inputs with key feedback and directional impact.
  - Update perspective.yml thinking_notes and repository_observations to preserve what changed after feedback.
  - Refresh perspective.yml feedback_assimilation.next_focus for the next cycle.
  - Create proposal.yml with importance, impact_surface, implementation_cost, consistency_risks, and verification_signals.
  - Update perspective.yml recent_proposals (FIFO, max 5, newest first) with the proposal title.
  - Delete idea.yml and all comments/*.yml.

output:
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/proposal.yml
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/perspective.yml (updated)

constraints:
  - "idea.yml and comments/*.yml must be deleted after proposal creation"
  - "recent_proposals must include the current proposal title and keep FIFO max 5"
