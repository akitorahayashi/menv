task: expand-requirement

objective:
  Perform deep analysis on the assigned requirement and expand it with system impact
  assessment, dependency analysis, risks, and implementation specifics.

inputs:
  - The embedded requirement content (provided after the prompt)

steps:
  - Read the target requirement and its deep_analysis_reason.
  - Analyze full system impact, dependency tree, affected areas, constraints,
    and risks.
  - Expand the requirement file with detailed analysis findings (append to
    deep_analysis_reason, preserving original rationale).
  - Set requires_deep_analysis to false and overwrite the requirement file.

output:
  - The requirement file expanded in-place with analysis details, requires_deep_analysis
    set to false.
