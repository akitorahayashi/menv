task: implement-bug

objective:
  Fix the reported bug with minimal, targeted changes. Ensure the fix addresses
  the root cause rather than masking the symptom.

steps:
  - Reproduce the described behaviour to confirm the bug.
  - Identify the root cause through code and test analysis.
  - Implement the fix with minimal scope — avoid unrelated changes.
  - Add or update tests that cover the fixed behaviour.
  - Run the project's verification suite (tests, linting, type checks).
  - Create a pull request referencing the requirement.

constraints:
  - Regression tests are mandatory — the fix must prove the bug is resolved.
  - Do not refactor surrounding code unless it is part of the root cause.
