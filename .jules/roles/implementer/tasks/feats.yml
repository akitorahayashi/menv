task: implement-feat

objective:
  Implement the new feature described in the requirement. Deliver working, tested code
  that integrates cleanly with the existing codebase.

steps:
  - Understand the feature specification and acceptance criteria in the requirement.
  - Design the implementation approach before writing code.
  - Implement the feature with appropriate abstractions.
  - Add comprehensive tests covering the new behaviour.
  - Update documentation if the feature changes public APIs or user-facing behaviour.
  - Run the project's verification suite (tests, linting, type checks).
  - Create a pull request referencing the requirement.

constraints:
  - "New public interfaces must have documentation."
  - "Feature flags or configuration should be used when the feature is non-trivial and incremental delivery is preferable."
  - "All development-related documentation must be written in English."
  - "Keep documentation for LLM (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) concise for token efficiency. Focus on essential information only."
  - "Documentation is written in a declarative style describing the current state. Imperative or changelog-style descriptions are avoided."
  - "Declarative updates preserve existing, correct content and integrate new content where appropriate, without duplication. Avoid ripping and replacing everything."
