task: implement-refact

objective:
  Refactor existing code as described in the requirement. Improve structure, readability,
  or maintainability without changing external behaviour.

steps:
  - Understand the refactoring scope and goals from the requirement.
  - Verify existing tests pass before making changes (establish baseline).
  - Apply refactoring incrementally — keep each change reviewable.
  - Ensure all existing tests still pass after refactoring.
  - Add tests if coverage gaps are discovered during refactoring.
  - Run the project's verification suite (tests, linting, type checks).
  - Create a pull request referencing the requirement.

constraints:
  - No observable behaviour changes unless explicitly stated in the requirement.
  - All existing tests must pass without modification (unless a test was testing incorrect behaviour).
