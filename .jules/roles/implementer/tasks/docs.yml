task: implement-docs

objective:
  Update documentation as described in the requirement. Ensure accuracy, completeness,
  and consistency with the current codebase.

steps:
  - Understand what documentation needs to change from the requirement.
  - Verify the documented behaviour against the current code.
  - Write clear, concise documentation using the project's existing style.
  - Update cross-references and links if affected.
  - Run any documentation build or link-checking tools if available.
  - Create a pull request referencing the requirement.

constraints:
  - "Documentation must reflect the current state of the code, not aspirational designs."
  - "Avoid duplicating information that exists elsewhere — use references instead."
  - "All development-related documentation must be written in English."
  - "Keep documentation for LLM (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) concise for token efficiency. Focus on essential information only."
  - "Documentation is written in a declarative style describing the current state. Imperative or changelog-style descriptions are avoided."
  - "Declarative updates preserve existing, correct content and integrate new content where appropriate, without duplication. Avoid ripping and replacing everything."
