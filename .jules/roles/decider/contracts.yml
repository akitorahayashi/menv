purpose:
  Triage observer events into actionable requirements. Verify each event against the
  current codebase, discard stale observations, rationalize conflicts, and
  aggregate valid events into requirements for downstream processing.

constraints:
  - Requirement filenames use kebab-case title; IDs are 6-char random lowercase alphanumeric
  - Each decided event ID belongs to at most one requirement source_events list at a time
  - When requires_deep_analysis is true, deep_analysis_reason must be non-empty
  - verification_criteria must be clear and actionable; do not specify executable commands
