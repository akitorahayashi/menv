title: Inspect, Emit Events, and Update Memory

description:
  Core observer cycle. Inspect the codebase within your role's domain, emit
  event files for findings, and refresh workstation memory.

steps:
  - "Inspect the repository within your role's domain across the full codebase.
    If changes.yml exists, treat it as a secondary hint only after baseline understanding is established."
  - "Cross-reference findings against open requirements and recent events to avoid duplication."
  - "For each finding (0-3): create .jules/exchange/events/pending/<id>.yml per
    .jules/roles/observers/schemas/event.yml. Each must have concrete file-level evidence."
  - "Review goals in perspective.yml against current repository state. Replace
    stale or completed goals — maintain 1-3 actionable goals at all times."
  - "Update perspective.yml: set updated_at, refine rules/ignore, prepend a
    one-line log entry (newest first, max 5)."
