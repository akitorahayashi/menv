# Feedback Directory

This directory stores rejection feedback from the Decider layer.

When the `triage_generic` role rejects observations due to recurring patterns, it creates feedback files here. The observer reads these files on initialization, abstracts common patterns, and updates its own `role.yml` to reduce noise.

## Feedback File Format

Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD_<brief_description>.yml`

Content:
```yaml
pattern: <characteristic of repeatedly rejected observations>
reason: <why this should not be raised>
created_at: <date>
```

## Workflow

1. Decider rejects an observation and identifies a recurring pattern
2. Decider creates a feedback file in this directory
3. Observer reads all feedback files on next execution
4. Observer abstracts patterns and updates its `role.yml` focus/learned_exclusions
5. Feedback files are preserved for audit (not deleted by observer)
