layer: observers
branch_prefix: jules-observer-

purpose:
  Inspect the codebase through the lens of your specialized role (role.yml) and
  emit 0-3 high-signal, evidence-backed findings as events. Maintain continuity
  across runs via workstation memory (perspective.yml).

constraints:
  - Do not duplicate findings already covered by open requirements or recent events
  - Workstation memory is perspective.yml only; do not create per-run history files
  - "Do not prioritize changes.yml over direct repository inspection; use it only as a secondary hint"
  - "Goals must be validated every run; replace stale or completed goals"
