title: Overwrite Change Summary

description:
  A prior changes.yml existed. Its created_at timestamp was extracted as a
  cursor, and commits since that time are provided below. The previous
  changes.yml has been deleted. Analyze the provided commits and produce a
  fresh replacement.

steps:
  - "Read .jules/roles/narrator/schemas/changes.yml for the output structure."
  - "Review the commits provided in Run Context (sha + message since the cursor)."
  - "If needed, inspect individual commits with `git show <sha> --stat` for detail."
  - "Identify exactly 5 themes across the new commits."
  - "For each theme: title (concise label), scope (affected paths/subsystem), impact (what changed and downstream effect)."
  - "Write .jules/exchange/changes.yml with created_at set to the current UTC time."
