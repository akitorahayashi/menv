title: Create First Change Summary

description:
  No prior changes.yml exists. This is the initial onboarding summary.
  Establish a baseline by sampling recent history.

steps:
  - "Read .jules/roles/narrator/schemas/changes.yml for the output structure."
  - "Use git to survey recent activity: `git log --oneline -20 --format='%H %ai %s'`
    and `git diff --stat HEAD~20..HEAD -- . ':(exclude).jules' ':(exclude).jlo'`."
  - "Identify exactly 5 themes across the sampled commits."
  - "For each theme: title (concise label), scope (affected paths/subsystem), impact (what changed and downstream effect)."
  - "Write .jules/exchange/changes.yml with created_at set to the current UTC time."
