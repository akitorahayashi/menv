# Rules

## Coding

- When adding new features or refactoring, removal of old modules and deprecated features is mandatory. Identify and eliminate all sources of technical debt, bugs, and complexity left behind.
- Never define class or file names with ambiguous responsibilities, such as base, core, utils, or helpers.
- Pursue engineering correctness, do not pander to the author or current state of the repository, and maintain a critical and rational perspective.

## Communication

- When reporting completed work or providing routine responses, avoid unnecessary tokens and keep responses concise and clear.
- Your answer must be based on the context of the repository.
Even if the question is in pursuit of general better engineering, the repository at hand is absolutely relevant. Answering immediately without doing research is prohibited. Doing necessary research is always permitted.

## Documentation

- All development-related documentation must be written in English.
- Keep documentation for LLM (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) concise for token efficiency. Focus on essential information only.
- Documentation is written in a declarative style describing the current state. Imperative or changelog-style descriptions are avoided.

## Safety

- Commands that discard uncommitted changes (for example `git checkout -- <path>`, `git restore`, `git reset`) are only run after explicit user approval and after creating a recoverable backup.
