# mev - macOS Environment Setup Project

## Overview

Rust-first CLI for macOS dev environment setup using bundled Ansible playbooks.
Installable via `pipx` through a thin Python launcher that delegates to the prebuilt `mev` binary.

## Architecture

| Layer | Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Application | `src/app/` | CLI boundary, command orchestration, dependency wiring |
| Domain | `src/domain/` | Pure rules, command invariants, execution planning, interfaces |
| Ports | `src/domain/ports/` | Interface boundaries required by domain/application |
| Adapters | `src/adapters/` | Process execution, file I/O, catalog loading, package asset resolution |
| Internal dep | `crates/mev-internal/` | Internal command domain implementations reused by mev |
| Python bootstrap | `python/mev_bootstrap/` | Thin launcher delegating to bundled binary |
| Distribution assets | `src/assets/` | Bundled binaries and ansible assets for dev and packaging |

## CLI Commands

See [README.md](README.md) for the list of available commands and usage instructions.

## Python Surface

Python ownership is limited to `python/mev_bootstrap/launcher.py`.
The launcher resolves packaged assets, sets `MEV_ANSIBLE_DIR`, and executes the bundled Rust binary.
Runtime command ownership belongs to the Rust implementation.

## Architecture Principles

### Directory Naming
- No ambiguous names: `core/`, `utils/`, `helpers/` are forbidden
- Every file must belong to a clear, specific category

## Design Rules

### Path Resolution
- CLI passes `profile`, `config_dir_abs_path`, `repo_root_path`, `local_config_root` as Ansible extra vars
- `local_config_root` points to `~/.config/mev/roles` for externalized configs
- Roles handle fallback logic (profile-specific → common)

### Profile Design
- Common profile by default: most roles use `common` profile
- Profile-specific configs: `brew` role supports profile-specific configs (macbook/mac-mini)
- Roles store configs in `config/common/` (all roles) and `config/profiles/` (brew only)

### Config Deployment Strategy
Two-stage config deployment:
1. Package → `~/.config/mev/roles/{role}/`: Copy via `mev config create` or auto-deploy on `mev make`
2. `~/.config/mev/roles/{role}/` → Local destinations: Symbolic links

### Development
- `just run <args>`: Run mev in dev mode
- `just check`: Format and lint
- `just test`: Run all Rust tests
- `just build-bundle`: Build release binary for pipx distribution
