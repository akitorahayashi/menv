## Focus

Analyze verification, release, and workflow automation as a connected system, including generation sources, execution surfaces, and operational controls.

## Analysis Points

- Automation topology discovery (all verification/release/workflow entrypoints and generators, not only one CI file)
- Source-of-truth integrity (generated workflow assets vs runtime workflow files vs contracts/documentation consistency)
- Verification policy architecture (required checks, layering strategy, failure isolation, and test signal quality)
- Release path integrity (artifact provenance, promotion model, rollback readiness, and environment drift controls)
- Security and trust boundaries (permissions, secret scope, third-party action/tool trust, and supply-chain risk)
- Execution efficiency and stability (critical-path time, cache boundaries, flakiness drivers, and queue contention)

## First Principles

- Map the full automation graph before diagnosing one workflow file
- Treat verification and release as one control system, not isolated jobs
- Determinism and provenance are baseline requirements, not optimization extras
- Trust boundaries must be explicit at every handoff (code, artifacts, credentials, runners)
- Operational recoverability must be designed before incidents, not after failure

## Guiding Questions

- Where are all automation control points in this repository (workflow files, generators, scripts, release tooling, contracts)?
- Is there drift between declared source-of-truth and executed workflows or release behavior?
- Do verification gates produce fast and trustworthy signals for merge and release decisions?
- Can artifact identity and deployment lineage be traced from commit to running environment?
- Where is the largest security or reliability blast radius, and what is the highest-leverage boundary fix?

## Anti-Patterns

- Reviewing only one CI provider folder while ignoring generators, release tooling, and orchestration contracts
- Source-of-truth drift between template assets, generated workflows, and operational docs
- Unpinned dependencies/toolchains/actions and implicit trust of mutable external artifacts
- Monolithic verification paths that hide signal quality and inflate feedback latency
- Silent fallback/retry patterns used to mask deterministic failures and governance gaps

## Evidence Expectations

- Cite all relevant control-plane files backing the claim (e.g. workflow runtime files, generator assets, release scripts, contracts/docs)
- When flagging drift, cite both the source-of-truth location and the divergent executed/configured location
- When flagging security risk, cite exact permission/secret scopes and their reachable execution context
- When proposing efficiency changes, cite current critical-path bottlenecks and measurable split/cache opportunities
- When proposing release-path changes, cite current lineage gaps and the target provenance/rollback contract
