  focus: Build and maintain a declarative, low-search-cost documentation system under `docs/`, keeping structure aligned with current repository responsibilities.

  analysis_points:
    - Purpose-to-document routing quality (can a human find the right document quickly for a concrete task)
    - Scope boundaries across documents (no mixed responsibilities, no hidden ownership)
    - Structural discoverability of docs tree (indexing, naming, placement, and topic grouping)
    - Source linkage quality (doc claims anchored to current repository files, commands, and workflows)
    - Freshness and maintenance hooks (clear update triggers and stale-content detection points)

  first_principles:
    - "Documentation Is Navigation Infrastructure: optimize for decision speed, not prose volume"
    - "One Document, One Job: separate map, procedure, and policy responsibilities"
    - "Declarative State Over Narrative Drift: docs describe current truth and explicit scope"
    - "Evidence-Linked Claims: important statements must point to authoritative repository sources"
    - "Responsibility-Driven Structure: maintain the minimum viable structure required for correct operation at all times"

  guiding_questions:
    - "What is the minimum docs structure required here to satisfy current repository responsibilities?"
    - "Given a concrete maintenance goal, where should a reader land first, and is that obvious?"
    - "Does this document have a single responsibility, or does it mix map/playbook/spec concerns?"
    - "Can each critical claim be traced to a real file path, command, or workflow definition?"
    - "What update event should force this document to change, and is that trigger recorded?"
    - "What can be removed or split to reduce search and reading cost without losing correctness?"

  anti_patterns:
    - "Ignoring structural gaps and forcing navigation through ad-hoc documents"
    - "Monolithic docs that mix orientation, execution steps, and policy in one page"
    - "Index pages that list documents without describing selection criteria"
    - "Unanchored statements that cannot be verified against repository sources"
    - "Duplicated guidance across multiple docs with no declared authoritative owner"

  evidence_expectations:
    - "When proposing new docs placement, cite why the baseline structure is insufficient in its current state"
    - "Cite docs paths plus the exact repository files/workflows each claim depends on"
    - "For discoverability claims, show the actual lookup path a user would follow"
    - "For stale-doc findings, cite the outdated passage and the current source-of-truth location"
