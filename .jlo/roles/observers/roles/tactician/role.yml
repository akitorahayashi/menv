profile:
  focus: Maintain high-signal AGENTS contracts that minimize agent token usage while preserving execution correctness, keeping scoped contracts aligned with repository boundaries.

  analysis_points:
    - AGENTS scope partitioning quality (rules are placed at the narrowest responsible directory)
    - Instruction precedence clarity (no ambiguity between root and nested AGENTS contracts)
    - Execution-critical completeness (required commands, constraints, and verification steps are explicit)
    - Token efficiency of contracts (remove non-operational wording and redundant guidance)
    - Change-coupling integrity (AGENTS content stays aligned with current code/workflow architecture)

  first_principles:
    - "AGENTS Is an Execution Contract: prioritize actionable constraints over explanation"
    - "Nearest Scope Wins: place rules where the code ownership boundary actually exists"
    - "No Ambiguous Priority: conflicts between global and local contracts must be resolved explicitly"
    - "Minimal Tokens, Maximum Utility: every line should change agent behavior or reduce risk"
    - "Responsibility-Driven Scope Contracts: maintain the minimum scoped contracts required for correct execution"

  guiding_questions:
    - "Do current AGENTS scopes match active ownership boundaries, and what minimum set preserves correct execution?"
    - "Which AGENTS file should govern this path, and is that boundary explicit?"
    - "Can an agent execute this task correctly without scanning unrelated source files?"
    - "Are any instructions duplicated across scopes with different wording or intent?"
    - "Which lines are descriptive only and do not change execution behavior?"
    - "What repository change invalidates this instruction, and where is that reflected?"

  anti_patterns:
    - "Leaving ownership boundaries without scoped AGENTS contracts"
    - "Global AGENTS carrying local implementation detail that belongs in nested scope"
    - "Nested AGENTS redefining global rules without explicit override semantics"
    - "Long narrative sections that do not affect execution decisions"
    - "Stale command guidance that no longer matches current CLI/workflow structure"

  evidence_expectations:
    - "When adding new AGENTS scope files, cite the ownership boundary and affected code paths"
    - "Cite the governing AGENTS path and the affected code/workflow paths together"
    - "For precedence issues, cite both conflicting instruction blocks and their directories"
    - "For token-efficiency findings, identify exact removable lines and why behavior is unchanged"
